## Manifesto

All good projects start with a manifesto.  Well, maybe they don't, but this one will.

 1. Small pieces, loosely joined.  Don't try to be all things to all people.  Reuse existing systems that already do well things that you want to do, focus on the parts they don't do, and how to weave them together into a greater whole.
 1. We believe in rough consensus and running code.  Think before you write, but don't think too much.  Sometimes making is thinking, but be ready to throw such thinking away if it goes in the wrong direction.
 1. Don't Repeat Yourself.  Don't make me enter data more than once.  Syndicate content and actions out from here, but also find ways to bring content into here (semi-)automatically.  Computers are good at copying things around and drudge work; let them do it to free up the humans for what they're good at.
 1. Forever is a long time.
